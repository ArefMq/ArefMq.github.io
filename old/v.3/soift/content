<p>Once upon time, there were two high school walking back home and talking about geeky computer stuff. Meanwhile, an idea popped up: What if computers could be re-invented? How they will be different from what they are now? Two lifelong research path formed that day.</p>
<p>As you know, computers designed many years ago; and the challenges faced by engineer that day were different from what we are faced now. Network links, storage space, processing power all were unreachable values back in 1973. However, today many of these problem solved. So, why we are still using the same design as 1973?</p>
<p><strong>Soift</strong> was the name of the idea of redesigning the computers in way that can take the advantage of todayâ€™s technology. For instance utilize more high-level technologies such as Artificial Intelligence inside in the design layer of the computer. And in general design the computer in way that can satisfy and cooperate with the Operating Systems more and more.</p>
<p>However the dream has forgotten over time, but the friendship and enthusiasm stayed strong and gets closer to the perfection as the days pass. I am sure it is possible to change the world with any brain watch the world from the different perspective that the others.</p>
