As a Software Engineer with over five years of experience, I have successfully completed an array of projects in varied fields such as web applications, enterprise software, and SaaS products. Additionally, I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and I enthusiastically follow the advances in machine learning.

  

When it comes to software development, I take an active approach by stepping up to tackle any challenges that may arise and assisting my teammates when needed. One of my core values is pair programming, and I find great pleasure in collaborating with others. In fact, I even introduced my previous team to mob programming. Additionally, I enjoy facilitating discussions within my team, both technical and non-technical, and helping to find solutions to any issues that arise.

  

Throughout my career, I've been a part of both successful and unsuccessful projects. I've worked in different robotics competitions, co-founded a tech startup, and been employed at various enterprises and large-scale companies. Overall I appreciate the startup culture and challenges, equally I find fulfillment in working at larger companies.
